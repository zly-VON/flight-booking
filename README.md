# Flight Booking System
## Application Suitability
* **Scalability**- A flight booking system deals with a high volume of users and transactions, microservices are the solution to enable independent scaling of varying loads.
* **Fault Tolerance** - If one service failes the other services won't be affected.
* **Easier Updates** - We can update or modify one service without stopping the whole application.

**Example** - *Amadeus* uses microservice-based architecture to handle a wide range of services such as flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and trip planning.

## Service Boundaries

#### Key Components
* User: The end-user interacts with the system through an API Gateway.
* API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
* Service 1: Handles user authentication and subscription to flight updates.
    * User Authentication: Verifies the user's identity or creates a new user profile after registration.
    * Subscription to Flight Updates: Manages user subscriptions for receiving notifications about flight updates.
* Service 2: Responsible for flight search and booking.
    * Search Flight: Queries a PostgreSQL database to retrieve flight information based on the user's search criteria.
    * Book Flight: Processes flight bookings and updates the database.
* Load Balancer: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure no single instance is overwhelmed.
* Service Discovery: Helps services dynamically find and communicate with each other in a system.

## Technology Stack and Communication Patterns
* **Services** - Python 
* **Databases** - PostgreSQL
* **Cache** - Redis
* **API Gateway** - JavaScript
* **Inter-service communication** - RESTful API / gRPC

## Deployment and Scaling
For deployment I'll use *Docker* to containerize each microservice, ensuring they run independently with their own dependencies. I will also use *Docker Compose* to manage all services together and *horizontal scaling* ( a Docker Composeâ€™s scaling feature) to allow multiple instances of a service to handle increased traffic efficiently.
